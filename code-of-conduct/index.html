        <h2>Code of conduct</h2>

        <h3>Why have a code of conduct?</h3>
        <p>Our goal is to create the best community in the world for learning. We want every member of the Ones and Zeros community to be able to focus their full attention on becoming a better programmer, both at Ones and Zeros and as a part of our community. This is impossible to do if you are being harassed, stalked, or discriminated against.</p>
        <p>Accordingly, all Participants, as well as guests and visitors, are expected to show respect and courtesy to each other in all interactions, whether at Ones and Zeros, in our online community, or in other contexts.</p>
        <p>To make sure that everyone has a common understanding of &ldquo;show respect and courtesy to each other,&rdquo; we have adopted the following code of conduct. The code of conduct is enforced by the Ones and Zeros facilitators.</p>

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>Ones and Zeros is dedicated to providing a harassment-free learning environment and community for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, age, race, religion, or anything else. We do not tolerate harassment in any form.</p>
        <p>All communication in Ones and Zeros spaces, in person and online, should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate in Ones and Zeros community spaces in any context.</p>
        <p>While Ones and Zeros is a professional community, it's also a community of friends. We ask you to be aware of the fact that conversations that may be appropriate within the context of a specific friendship or relationship with another Attendee may be inappropriate in the Ones and Zeros space or in a group conversation with Participants you don't know well.</p>
        <p>Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other Participants. Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate for Ones and Zeros.</p>
        <p>Participants violating these rules may be asked to leave the community at the sole discretion of the Ones and Zeros facilitators.</p>
        <p>Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly community for all.</p>

        <h3>Details</h3>
        <p>Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.</p>
        <p>Community members asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.</p>
        <p>Be careful in the words that you choose. Remember that sexist, racist, and other exclusionary jokes can hurt those around you. Excessive swearing and offensive jokes are not appropriate at Ones and Zeros.</p>
        <p>If a participant violates this code of conduct, the Ones and Zeros facilitators may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the community.</p>

        <h3>Social rules</h3>
        <p>In addition to having a code of conduct, we have four lightweight <a href="/social-rules/">social rules</a>. The social rules are different and separate from the code of conduct. They help us create a better learning environment by giving names to counterproductive behavior and acting as a release valve so that frustration doesn't build up over time. We expect people to unintentionally break the social rules from time to time. Doing this doesn't make you a bad person or a bad Attendee. When this happens, it's not a big deal. Just apologize and move on.</p>
        <p>The enforcement provisions in this code of conduct do not apply to the social rules. We definitely won't give you a strong warning or expel you from the Ones and Zeros community just for breaking a social rule.</p>
        <p>If you have any questions about any part of the code of conduct or social rules, please reach out to any Ones and Zeros facilitator.</p>

        <h3>Getting help</h3>
        <p>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a Ones and Zeros facilitator.</p>
        <p>We will be happy to do whatever we can to help those experiencing harassment to feel safe as part of the Ones and Zeros community. We value your contributions to Ones and Zeros and are dedicated to providing you a learning environment free from harassment.</p>
