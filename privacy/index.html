        <h2>Privacy policy</h2>

        <p>We don't have a cookie warning because we don't use cookies at all and we don't use trackers. We just want to run workshops and classes &ndash; our aim is to collect and store the bare minimum information we need to do that.</p>

        <p>We do use some third-party services to make everything work, and unfortunately some of those services might add tracking that we can't turn off. Here are some of the services that we use:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>GitHub for free web hosting. They do not add JavaScript tracking, but may log basic information like visitor IP addresses.</li>
          <li>CloudFlare for free HTTPS. CloudFlare adds a cookie that they use to increase performance. They might use this to further track individual visitors, and may log basic information like visitor IP addresses. GitHub is now able to provide free HTTPS certificates for custom domains, so we plan to remove CloudFlare, reducing the number of services that can track you when you visit us.</li>
          <li>GumRoad provides payment processing. GumRoad can track you during the checkout flow when you click a link to submit a payment to us.</li>
          <li>AirTable hosts our feedback and registration forms.</li>
          <li>MailChimp for email campaigns.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We do not use any Google services to operate this website. We operate Facebook, Instagram and Twitter accounts, but they are not loaded on this website – you're only subject to their tracking if you visit us on their respective platforms.</p>

        <p>We'll ask you to sign a photo release if you show up to our events. It's optional! If you sign it, we may use photos of you on this website, our social media accounts, or in other kinds of promotion. These photos are really helpful for future participants to see what our events are like.</p>

        <p>This document is a work-in-progress and may be incomplete. We're working on it. Please <a href="/contact/">get in touch</a> if you have any questions or concerns.</p>
