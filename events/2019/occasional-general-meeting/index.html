        <p>Celebrate our first half-year, share some food, and talk about what's to come in 2019.</p>

        <p><em>Thanks everyone for coming and calling in!</em></p>

        <h3>Follow-up</h3>

<p>Hello! Thanks for coming to the first Ones and Zeros OGM! (or for asking for the notes if you weren't there).

<p>Important things first:

<ol>
  <li><p><strong>Add your availability</strong> for a first meeting about the Sidewalk Toronto Workshop Series Mini Course Discussions Thing That Needs A Better Name, if you're interested in that!
  <li><p><strong>Your availability</strong> to talk about next steps for TTZ – Toronto Tech Zines, and add any zine-makers you think may be interested (you can add yourself here too!). Sheet view (hard to share an editable version unfortunately)
  <p>Let me know if you want to be involved with these but can't necessarily show up in person in the next week -- we can either call you in or keep you in the loop with meeting notes.
  <li><p><strong>Any feedback you had</strong> about the meeting itself, or anything, even this very email!
</ol>

<p>--

<p>Alright, so 15ish of y'all wonderful folks came or called in to Paperhouse Studio a week ago for this meeting! Amazing! Thank you! Here are the <a href="https://slides.com/philschleihauf/occasional-general-meeting/">slides</a> (which don't have a lot of info on them but hey).

<p>Here were my key takeaways from the meeting:

<h4>Binary Solo Workshop</h4>

<ul>
  <li>It would benefit from being more directional, with clearer next steps for participants.
  <li>It's hard to explain, communicate, and market, but some words and phrases that came up:
    <ul>
      <li>There is something in it for everyone
      <li>It's about revealing some underlying parts of technology
    </ul>
  <li>Thermal printers are interesting, but playing with them doesn't open obvious doors for next steps
  <li>One workshop is not enough! Folks want more! ❤
</ul>

<p>With those in mind, here are my next steps with this workshop:
<ul>
  <li>Reengage past participants with more Open Studio-type events (I'm going to set one up soon)
    <ul>
      <li>Also engage interested folks who haven't yet attended a workshop with these events! There are a bunch of them!
    </ul>
  <li>Get the next workshop going already :)
  <li>Try running Binary Solo as a two-day workshop (shorter days, which also addresses an accessibility concern that has come up)
  <li>Use the "past participants" email list a little more -- other communication channels I've been using (eg., slack) are not as effective.
</ul>

<h4>Sidewalk series mini-course</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Monday evenings in March/April, with the following structure:
    <ul>
      <li>1.5hr: tech workshop/play/poetry series for 8ish participants who register
      <li>food
      <li>20mins: short talk on diverse topics related to privacy and surveillance (esp. related to Sidewalk Toronto)
      <li>40mins: flexible discussion time
    </li>
  <li>The <a href="https://waterfrontnc.ca/">Waterfront Neighbourhood Centre</a> (WNC) has great rooms I want to use for this. It's walking distance from the planned development area of Sidewalk Toronto.
  <li>There are a whole bunch of relevant events coming up (thank you to those who followed up with tips!), a few of which conflict with some of the evenings I've reserved at WNC. I haven't actually paid the deposits yet, and the announcement/registration for this whole thing has been delayed, so the most important next step is to reassess the schedule for this.
</ul>

<p>If any of this is interesting, add your availability and lets talk more at the next meeting! (soon!)

<h4>Toronto Tech Zines</h4>

<ul>
  <li>A bunch of folks are putting on relevant events all over the place. A few that came up:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.rrreplica.org/">Ciudad de Mexico Zine Fair</a> Feb 1-3 I think
      <li><a href="https://czf-con.github.io/">Computery zine fest</a> on the west coast Feb 24
      <li><a href="http://www2.torontocomics.com/">TCAF</a> is May 11-12 this year
      <li><a href="https://www.instagram.com/tinytechzines/">Tiny Tech Zines</a> is July 28 in LA
      <li>The <a ref="http://techzinefair.org/">New York Tech Zine Fair</a> folks have mentioned to me intentions of another run there
      <li>Between everyone who was at the meeting, we actually have a lot of connections to these other events, so it would be awesome to keep a conversation open with them to learn together!
    </ul>
  <li>I finally made <strong>a table for</strong> zine makers we may want to reach out to. I'll share access with everyone who ends up working on this, but for now to add folks please <a href="https://airtable.com/shr05CfWZltORRIJg">use this form</a>.
  <li>We can do this as a pilot -- smaller event, shorter timeline, lower cost -- with, "we're going to do it again in the future!"
  <li>We need to find a date and some space! Lets push it back a little past May! :p
</ul>

<p>Lets meet and talk more about this -- there's an availability calendar for the next meeting. See you there!

<p>Thanks again y'all -- I can't wrap my head around the fact that there are over 20 people BCC'd here ❤
